In just seven months, the world might not change much, but you certainly can. As a seasoned software developer, I’ve navigated the swift currents of technology and personal ambition to discover that focus — not speed — is the key to profound and lasting improvement. Join me as we explore how setting a deliberate pace in a fast-moving world can lead to significant personal and professional growth. Whether you’re polishing your coding skills or shaping your career path, let’s learn to harness the power of dedicating time to what truly matters.

## Reason

Whether you’re a fellow software engineer (like I suspect you might be) or not, this article has something for everyone. You might even find a few helpful tips that could change the way you work or think.

As software engineers, our world moves fast. What today is an idea or a rumour, tomorrow is a standard and the whole world is using it. I guess reading this lines your mind goes in the same place as mine — AI. Although people have been working on developing AI for decades, once it took shape into something accessible to everyone, it took over the world in a matter of months.

These rapid advancements in the world of technology are what keep our work exciting and engaging. There’s never a dull moment! And even if you’re not a software engineer, chances are you work on a computer and use technology regularly. However, along with the benefits of these advancements comes anxiety, imposter syndrome, and the nagging question:

> Am I or my work still relevant?

I want you to know that you’re not alone in feeling this way. It’s a common experience shared by many in our fast-paced, ever-changing world. In this article, we’ll explore ways to navigate these challenges and come out on top. So, grab a warm beverage, get comfortable, and let’s dive in together!

## Context

You might be wondering, “Why seven months? Why not six, or nine, or twelve?” Let me share a personal milestone: I set myself a goal to get into great shape and launch at least one personal project before turning 40. I’ve been working out for many years and was already in decent shape, though a tad heavier than I felt comfortable with. I was also working on personal projects, but I never finished anything because the question I mentioned earlier — “Am I or my work still relevant?” — kept creeping in, causing me to constantly switch contexts and projects.

So, why seven months? Honestly, there’s no scientific reason — it’s simply the timeframe I chose that felt right. It’s a personal challenge. If you’re considering a similar journey, choose a timeframe that feels manageable to you — anything between six to nine months is ideal. Anything longer might feel too slow, and anything shorter might not allow enough time to see real, tangible results.

> The core of this article is about finding the focus and courage to commit to one goal, without the fear of missing out on other opportunities as the world rapidly changes around us.

It’s about claiming your own pace in a fast-moving world, so you can truly shine.

## The Fear Of Missing Out

Throughout my nearly 20-year career in software development, I’ve embarked on numerous projects — some as hobbies, some for learning, and others driven by the dream of creating products that might lead to financial freedom. It’s with a touch of sadness that I confess I didn’t finish any of them. Until recently, that is — but more on that soon.

I spent some time reflecting deeply on why none of these projects reached completion. Was it the allure of new, shiny ideas? Or perhaps the transition from the excitement of development to the more mundane tasks of testing and bug fixing? Surprisingly, the answer to both was a resounding “No.” My enthusiasm for my ideas never waned, despite the constant emergence of new ones. I love every phase of software development, so what was holding me back?

After some serious introspection, I realized the root of my struggle was fear — fear of being left behind by the ever-evolving tech landscape. This fear created a mental block, preventing me from seeing that I had enough time to finish my current project before moving on to the next. And just when I thought I had it figured out, a new dilemma arose:

> What if I need to learn a new topic while also building my next project? Damn, now I was blocked again. How could I get out of this situation?

# Life Has Seasons Too

One beautiful spring day, while finally listening to the song of the birds and being embraced by the warmth of the sun, I realized how beautiful spring is. How it brings renewal and hope. Then another thought came to my mind — Is spring my favorite season? Then I realized I love all seasons just the same for what they bring. And they all bring something different.

> Just like the year has its seasons, life has them too.

There are seasons for building and others for learning. There’s no need to do them at the same time. You will not miss anything by learning what you want to learn later, or by building what you want to build once you’ve finished your season of learning. And even better, sometimes while learning you must build, and often when building you must learn. But nevertheless, your focus should be on one thing at a time. One of the great resources out there is the very famous book by Cal Newport, Deep Work.

Also, if you are coming out of a heavy season, consider taking a break. Recharge, heal, rebuild yourself before you start a new season with all its challenges and beauty.

## How To Choose What To Focus On?

When I realized that for the next seven months (in my case), I would have to choose one area to focus on, a grounding and mindful feeling washed over me. It’s a serious moment — choosing my season. Am I in a season of learning, or in a season of building? Once this decision is made, the next step is to choose my topic: What is the project I will focus on until it’s complete? What is the topic I will immerse myself in until I have mastered it?

Being thoughtful about what we dedicate our most valuable commodity — time — to is something we should always strive to do.

> If there’s one thing we should be perpetually mindful of, it’s how we spend our time.

This ensures that whatever we pick is not only important and worthy but also serves as a potent motivator to maintain our focus for the next seven months.

I always follow these steps when deciding what to focus on:

1. Determining whether I’m in a learning season or a building season.
2. Identifying the top three projects I want to build or topics I want to learn.
3. From these options, selecting the one that excites me the most right now.
4. [OPTIONAL] If all options equally excite me, choosing the one that best serves my purpose, interests, or business at this moment.

Remember, this is your journey, and you have the power to shape it in a way that brings you joy, fulfilment, and growth. Don’t be afraid to take a step back, assess your priorities, and make choices that align with your values and goals. You’ve got this!

## Why Do I Have To Choose Just One?

No matter how smart you are, you can only give your 100% to one thing at a time. A quote that once resonated with me and has since stuck is:

> “How you do one thing, you do everything.”

Learn to focus on one thing at a time and do it right. You chose to spend your time on it, so give it your best effort while you’re at it.

Also, considering the timeline you’ve set, if you aim to respect it and build something valuable that can be considered a finished product, you’ll need full focus.

I know it can be tempting to try and juggle multiple projects or learning goals at once, especially when you’re passionate about so many things. By focusing on one thing at a time, you allow yourself the opportunity to fully immerse yourself in the process, learn deeply, and create something truly remarkable.

Many of us have jobs, which means we have limited time to invest in the extra projects we decide to focus on. Some of you are also parents, making your time even more precious. Given all these aspects of what we call “life,” it makes an even stronger argument for focusing on one thing at a time. This way, in the limited hours we have to invest in our passions, we can truly give our all.

Remember, it’s not about doing everything at once. It’s about doing one thing exceptionally well and then moving on to the next. By adopting this mindset, you’ll find that you’re able to accomplish more and with greater depth and quality. So, be kind to yourself, and give yourself permission to focus on one thing at a time.

## Finish!

One lesson I’ve learned is that no matter what we choose to start, it holds no value until we finish it. Completing what we’ve begun is what brings joy and satisfaction from the time we’ve invested in our chosen project. If we don’t finish, we’re left with the bitter taste of wasted time — and believe me, I’ve felt it many times; it’s not something I recommend.

Finishing brings closure; it allows us to move on to the next thing without the nagging feeling of unfinished business. Closure is important! This doesn’t mean that once you build a project that could become a business, you stop there. But you have finished the building phase. You succeeded.

> Once you’ve finished, celebrate. Enjoy! You did it. Take a break, take a holiday — do anything that makes you feel successful, because you are.

Remember, finishing is a habit, just like anything else. The more you practice it, the easier it becomes. So, keep pushing forward, keep focusing on your goals, and keep finishing what you start. You have the power to create incredible things, and I have no doubt that you will.

## Conclusion

We live in interesting and challenging times. Working at a slow and focused pace might seem impossible with the speed at which things change and evolve. But that’s just a perception — in reality, it isn’t impossible. We might not always have five years to focus on one thing, but we can adapt and invest a substantial number of months in whatever we feel is valuable to us. Let’s not allow this fast-paced era to hinder our growth. Instead, let’s create our own timeline that allows us to evolve and create at a pace we are comfortable with, while taking advantage of all the progress around us.

Thank you for reading.

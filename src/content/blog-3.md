I found the following tweet online:

As I mentioned in my reply, I got very inspired by this list. As a senior Java engineer myself, I realised, I am probably familiar with most topics on this list but since I don’t use them daily, a refresh and a place where to store them all could benefit me and others as well. So I will share my notes on the first topic.

## CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem, also known as Brewer’s Theorem, outlines the fundamental trade-offs that must be considered when designing distributed applications and databases.

### What is the CAP Theorem?

1. **Consistency (C)**:

- Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
- All nodes see the same data at the same time.

2. **Availability (A)**:

- Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
- The system remains operational 100% of the time.

3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**:

- The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures.
- The system can handle communication breakdowns between nodes.

## Why Can’t We Have All Three?

In a distributed system where partitions (network failures) can occur, you must choose between consistency and availability:

- If you prioritize consistency (CP system): The system may become unavailable during network partitions to ensure all nodes have consistent data.
- If you prioritize availability (AP system): The system remains operational, but some nodes may have stale data until consistency is restored.

## Applying the CAP Theorem in Java Backend Development

As a Java backend developer, you often interact with distributed systems, databases, and microservices where the CAP Theorem is highly relevant.

### 1. Choosing Between Consistency and Availability

**Consistency Priority (CP Systems):**

- Use Case: Financial transactions, inventory management.

Implementation:

- Distributed Transactions: Use technologies like JTA (Java Transaction API) to manage transactions across multiple resources.
- Two-Phase Commit Protocol: Ensure all nodes agree on a transaction before committing.
- Synchronous Replication: Write operations are replicated synchronously to all nodes.

**Availability Priority (AP Systems):**

- Use Case: Social media feeds, real-time analytics.

Implementation:

- Eventual Consistency: Accept that data will become consistent over time.
- Asynchronous Replication: Write operations are replicated asynchronously.
- Fallback Mechanisms: Use cached data when fresh data isn’t available.

### 2. Database Selection

**Relational Databases (CP Systems):**

- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL with Galera Cluster.
- Features: Strong consistency, ACID transactions.
- Java Integration: JDBC, JPA (Java Persistence API), Hibernate.

**NoSQL Databases (AP Systems):**

- Examples: Cassandra, DynamoDB.
- Features: High availability, eventual consistency.
- Java Integration: Using drivers provided by the database vendors.

**Configurable Databases:**

- Example: MongoDB can be tuned for consistency or availability.
- Java Integration: MongoDB Java Driver, allowing configuration of read/write concerns.

### 3. Microservices Architecture

**Consistency Focused Microservices:**

Synchronous Communication:

- Use RESTful APIs with HTTP calls.
- Ensure immediate consistency but risk reduced availability during network issues.

Transactions Across Services:

  - Implement Saga Pattern for distributed transactions.
  - Use Event Sourcing to maintain a consistent state.

**Availability Focused Microservices:**

Asynchronous Communication:

- Use Message Brokers like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- Employ Event-Driven Architecture to decouple services.

**Resilience Patterns:**

- Implement Circuit Breakers using libraries like Hystrix.
- Use Bulkheads and Fallbacks to maintain availability.

### 4. Handling Network Partitions

**Design Strategies:**

Timeouts and Retries:

- Configure appropriate timeouts for network calls.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

Idempotent Operations:

- Design APIs to handle retries without side effects.

Data Replication and Sharding:

- Distribute data across nodes to minimize the impact of partitions.
- Use consistent hashing to route requests.

### 5. Consistency Models in Java

**Strong Consistency:**

Implementation:

- Use synchronized blocks or Reentrant Locks for thread safety.
- Employ atomic operations with java.util.concurrent.atomic package.

**Eventual Consistency:**

Implementation:

- Use Caching Mechanisms like Ehcache or Caffeine.
- Implement Data Versioning and Conflict Resolution strategies.

## Design Patterns

Implement patterns like Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, and Retry to handle failures gracefully.

## Conclusion

I will keep track of my notes and my paper implementations related to each topic (where it fits) in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andreivisan/arc2cracked/tree/main/3.Java/java40).
